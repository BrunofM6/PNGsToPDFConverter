# PNGs to PDF Converter
## What is this?
Small python script that, depending on the ammount of pages you want on your pdf, will continuously ask for the system file paths of the PNGs and output one single 'output.pdf' file with all of them as pages. All PNGs are assumed to have the same height and width. Originally created to print some stuff from two PNGs. To not print two pages, I had to turn them into a single PDF, so I created this small script. Feel free to use as needed! :D
